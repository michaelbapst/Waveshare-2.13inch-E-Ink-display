WeatherInk.py takes Latitude and Longitude coordinates and returns weather information, and displays it on an E-Ink display.<br>
I wrote this as an exercise to use an E-Ink display, and get weather info. The GPS function was a bonus. There are still issues with the code, 
throws an error when trying to convert GPS coordinates to a place without name, etc. Use at your own risk.
